# Auto_Summarization_Tool
Implementing an automatic text summarization Tool, using python and with the help of 2 research papers.
Summarization can be done in 2 ways:
1. Statistical Approach
2. Linguistic Approach

The **Linguistic Approach** involves human based approach for generating summaries of large documents, or articles.It is quite abstract way to generate summary and relies heavily on Natural Language Processing(NLP).
The **Statistical Approach** involves use of word frequency, sentence scores, and even some graph based approach to determine what are the most relevant sentences in the given article.

Following is a list of Python Libraries that are used:

* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Networkx
* re
* NLTK
* Collections

In this project, i am using **Statistical Approach**. The whole program is basically divided into 4 modules/Classes.
